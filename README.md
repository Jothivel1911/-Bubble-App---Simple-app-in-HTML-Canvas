Title: Bubble App - Simple Game in HTML Canvas

Description: This code creates a simple game using HTML canvas, where bubbles move from right to left and the player clicks on them before they cross the left boundary. The game has four bubbles with different colors and labels, and arrows connect the right and left boundaries of the canvas with each bubble. When a bubble is clicked, it turns gray and its label changes to "success". The code defines Circle and Arrow functions to draw the bubbles and arrows, and implements event listeners to trigger actions when the user clicks on a bubble.
